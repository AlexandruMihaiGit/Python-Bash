# Python-Bash

As I continue to develop my knowledge in networking and cybersecurity, I occasionally create small Python and Bash scripts to practice my skills. These scripts serve as a way to sharpen my technical abilities and to gain a deeper understanding of fundamental concepts such as network scanning, brute-forcing, or automating various security processes. Each script represents my effort to practically apply what I'm learning, while also preparing me for more advanced projects in cybersecurity.
